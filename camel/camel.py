# some program language like c++: camelCase
# but snake case is preferred in python: var_name_of_sth (the underscore)

# purpose: consume a camelCase for a snake case version
# sign: str-> str
def to_snake_case(string):
    # add underscore (comes before tolower cuz the cap letter is the sign to add space)
    if 
    # change into lower



# examples: name, firstName, preferredFirstName

# no .strip() cuz neither case has space in between
# precondition: user's input is in camel case
# single direction from camel to snake: .lower(), when isupper()
# , change to lower and add space bef

def main():

    print(to_snake_case("name"))               #
    print(to_snake_case("firstName"))          #
    print(to_snake_case("preferredFirstName")) #

main()
