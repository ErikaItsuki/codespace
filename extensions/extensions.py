# filename extension(e.g. .txt, .gif)
# Filename extensions may be considered a type of metadata.[2] They are commonly
# used to imply information about the way data might be stored in the file.
# (metadata = data that provides info about other data)
# When you double-click on a file to open it, your computer uses its file extension
# to determine which program to launch.
